# National Animals Inventory

An app for keeping the inventory of animals officially designated as a country's national animal. I've used this project to practice using Node.js for server-side app development.

- CRUD app development
- Routing
- Express
- Express Validator
- EJS
- Environment Variables
- Railway.app (App and DB Hosting provider)
- PostgreSQL (Database)
- Draw.io (Database prototyping)

- User authentication before deleting and updating data
